### What is this game?

_Open Terrarium_ is an open world, open source, 2D block based sandbox game where you can mine and craft.



### Why is this different than the thousands of other 2D Terraria clones?

_Open Terrarium_ is written in a higher level language so that it's much easier to modify, debug, add into, and program in general.



### Why Love 2D?

Love 2D has an extensive, fast, and easy to learn API written in LUA which makes programming easier and fun.



### How do I run this game?

Currently this is in alpha, version 0.0.1 and has no packed executable. You can open a terminal, cd into the directory, and type _love ._ to run the game.




### Notes:

When programming, using Geany IDE seems to be the easiest. How to easily run the game using the _F5_ key is to go into _Build -> Set Build Commands_, then change the _Execute_ section to this:
